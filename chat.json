The idea is that a user can claim a ball (component) if the component is neutral and if they pay 0.01 ETH, they can claim it for their nation. Additionally, every ball starts with 100 points, that can be reduced when someone attacks a ball, or incremented when someone provides points to it. A user can provide points by clicking on a button click, that accumulate over the session, and, when selecting a ball, choosing to transfer those points. This is a transfer that they need to sign and will be sent on chain. The amount of points that the smartcontract has then will add the new ones, and there should be a state on amount of points that it has. Also the nation that belongs the ball should be in the state, neutral at the beginning, and another if someone claims it, or if someone from another nation attacks the ball and conquers it. For this the the attacking points that will get substracted to the original ball points, and if the number gets negative, the ball is conquered, and is part of the new nation with the amount of points resuling but in positive (Example: a ball had 10 points, gets attacked by nation 1 with 15, now the ball belongs to nation 1 with 5 points). A ball can only attack another one with maximum A) 90% of their current points B) 100% of the points that the user has created for its nation.  \ufeff \ufeffThe nations that are available can change over time, a user can create a new nation paying 0.02 eth and writing a name. The wallet of that user will belong to that nation. A user can join another nation for free as long as that wallet is not part of a nation so far, otherwise, a user can pay 0.005 eth for chainging nation, they can only select nations thta exits for this, or create a new nation.   The amount of nations and their stats will be loaded in NationStats.sol contract, which will have the total aomount of attacking points a nation has and the total number of balls. So when a ball gets attacked, this information has to go to the BallStats.sol and to the NationStats.sol. This should be displayed   The user should be able to see, on their wallets: How many points available they have, which nation they belong to, and how many points each ball has when clicking on it. To attack a ball the user will select one ball and click on attack and select another one, this will trigger a trasnasction they need to sign and the amount of points will get reduced from his balance and the ball\u2019s balance as well as from the attacked ball balance.  Focus now only on the BallStats.sol, the rest is for context",

Implemented the main functionalities: claiming balls, providing points, attacking balls, creating and joining nations.\n2. Used SafeMath for arithmetic operations to prevent overflows.\n3. Implemented access control using Ownable from OpenZeppelin.\n4. Added events for important state changes.\n5. Included view functions to get ball and nation statistics.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n- Users must join a nation before claiming a ball.\n- The contract assumes that ETH is the native currency of the blockchain it's deployed on.\n- The contract doesn't have a function to create balls; it assumes ball IDs exist and can be claimed.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Deploy the contract to your chosen network.\n2. Users should first create or join a nation before claiming balls.\n3. Ensure users have enough ETH to pay for transactions (claiming balls, creating nations, etc.).\n4. Use the provided functions to manage balls, points, and nations.\n\nRemember to replace the placeholder Ownable() constructor if you want to set a specific initial owner.\n",

The idea is that a user can claim a ball (component) if the component is neutral and if they pay 0.01 ETH, they can claim it for their nation. Additionally, every ball starts with 100 points, that can be reduced when someone attacks a ball, or incremented when someone provides points to it. A user can provide points by clicking on a button click, that accumulate over the session, and, when selecting a ball, choosing to transfer those points. This is a transfer that they need to sign and will be sent on chain. The amount of points that the smartcontract has then will add the new ones, and there should be a state on amount of points that it has. Also the nation that belongs the ball should be in the state, neutral at the beginning, and another if someone claims it, or if someone from another nation attacks the ball and conquers it. For this the the attacking points that will get substracted to the original ball points, and if the number gets negative, the ball is conquered, and is part of the new nation with the amount of points resuling but in positive (Example: a ball had 10 points, gets attacked by nation 1 with 15, now the ball belongs to nation 1 with 5 points). A ball can only attack another one with maximum A) 90% of their current points B) 100% of the points that the user has created for its nation.  \ufeff \ufeffThe nations that are available can change over time, a user can create a new nation paying 0.02 eth and writing a name. The wallet of that user will belong to that nation. A user can join another nation for free as long as that wallet is not part of a nation so far, otherwise, a user can pay 0.005 eth for chainging nation, they can only select nations thta exits for this, or create a new nation. When someone joins/creates a nation, there should be an nft creted on their wallet that tells what nation are they from, also, the points that someone has are stored as a nft, that should be deleted and reupdated each time that a user does something  The amount of nations and their stats will be loaded in NationStats.sol contract, which will have the total aomount of attacking points a nation has and the total number of balls. So when a ball gets attacked, this information has to go to the BallStats.sol and to the NationStats.sol. This should be displayed   The user should be able to see, on their wallets: How many points available they have, which nation they belong to, and how many points each ball has when clicking on it. To attack a ball the user will select one ball and click on attack and select another one, this will trigger a trasnasction they need to sign and the amount of points will get reduced from his balance and the ball\u2019s balance as well as from the attacked ball balance.  Focus now only on the BallStats.sol, the rest is for context",

Added a withdraw function to allow the owner to withdraw collected fees.\n4. Added more detailed error messages for better debugging.\n5. Added events for important state changes, including NationStatsContractUpdated and Withdrawn.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n- The nationStatsContract address is set to a placeholder value in the constructor. You should update this address after deployment using the setNationStatsContract function.\n- The contract assumes the existence of a NationStats contract with an updateStats function. Ensure this contract is properly set up before interacting with it.\n- The costs for claiming balls, creating nations, and joining nations are fixed. If you need to change these values, you'll need to add functions to update them.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Deploy the contract to your chosen network.\n2. After deployment, call setNationStatsContract with the actual address of your NationStats contract.\n3. Users can then interact with the contract by calling the various functions like claimBall, attackBall, createNation, etc.\n4. The contract owner can withdraw collected fees using the withdraw function.\n\nRemember to thoroughly test the contract in a test environment before deploying it to the main network.\n",

Created a contract that allows users to create nations for 0.02 ETH and join existing nations for 0.005 ETH.\n2. Implemented functions to create nations, join nations, update stats, and retrieve stats.\n3. Added events to track nation creation, joining, and stat updates.\n4. Used OpenZeppelin's Ownable for access control and SafeMath for safe arithmetic operations.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n- The contract assumes that nation names are unique.\n- Only the contract owner can update nation stats.\n- Users can create only one nation per address.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Deploy the contract to your desired network.\n2. Users can create nations by calling `createNation` and sending 0.02 ETH.\n3. Users can join existing nations by calling `joinNation` and sending 0.005 ETH.\n4. The contract owner can update nation stats using the `updateStats` function.\n5. Anyone can view nation stats using the `getStats` function.\n\nRemember to handle any ETH sent to the contract by implementing a withdrawal function or defining a specific use for the funds.\n",

The table is now shown at the top of the component and updates automatically when new nations are created or joined.\n\nHowever, there's an important caveat: Due to the limitations of the smart contract, which doesn't provide a method to retrieve all existing nations, the component can only display stats for nations that have been created or interacted with during the current session. This means that if a user refreshes the page or opens the app in a new session, they won't see nations created in previous sessions unless they interact with them again.\n\nTo mitigate this, I've implemented a `knownNations` state that keeps track of nations the user has interacted with. This list persists only for the duration of the session. For a more complete solution, you might want to consider modifying the smart contract to include a function that returns all created nations, or implement a backend service to keep track of all nations across sessions.\n\nThe create nation and join nation functionalities remain unchanged, but now they automatically update the all nations stats table when successful.\n",

Updated the contract address to the correct one: 0xeD0316730198ECF315C78Ba64A88f95f9e92Cc1f.\n2. Updated the ABI to match the functions in the provided contract.\n3. Removed irrelevant functions related to ball interactions.\n4. Renamed the component to NationStatsInteraction to reflect its new focus.\n5. Adjusted the UI to focus on nation creation, joining, and viewing stats.\n6. Implemented proper error handling for the nation creation function.\n7. Added a check to see if the user has already created a nation, as the contract only allows one nation creation per address.\n\nThe component now provides functionality to create a nation, join a nation, and view nation stats. It also includes proper error handling and success messages. Please note that users can only create one nation per address, so the \"Create Nation\" button will not be shown if the user has already created a nation.\n\nTo use this component, make sure you're connected to the Holesky testnet (Chain ID: 17000) and have some test ETH in your wallet for the transaction fees.\n",

Created functions for creating nations, joining nations, viewing nation stats, and updating nation stats.\n2. Implemented NFT minting for both nation creators and joiners using OpenZeppelin's ERC721.\n3. Added proper access control using OpenZeppelin's Ownable.\n4. Implemented events for nation creation, joining, and stat updates.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n1. I used a placeholder address for the BallStats contract. You'll need to update this after deployment using the setBallStatsContract function.\n2. The contract assumes that the BallStats contract will handle the logic for when to update nation stats.\n3. The NFT minting function is simple and doesn't differentiate between creator and joiner NFTs. You may want to extend this functionality if needed.\n\nTo deploy and interact with the contract:\n1. Deploy the contract with no constructor arguments.\n2. After deployment, call setBallStatsContract with the actual address of the BallStats contract.\n3. Users can create nations by calling createNation and paying 0.02 ETH.\n4. Users can join nations by calling joinNation and paying 0.005 ETH.\n5. Anyone can view nation stats using getNationStats.\n6. Only the BallStats contract can update nation stats using updateNationStats.\n\nRemember to thoroughly test the contract before deploying it to the mainnet.\n",
