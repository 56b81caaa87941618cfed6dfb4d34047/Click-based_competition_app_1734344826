The idea is that a user can claim a ball (component) if the component is neutral and if they pay 0.01 ETH, they can claim it for their nation. Additionally, every ball starts with 100 points, that can be reduced when someone attacks a ball, or incremented when someone provides points to it. A user can provide points by clicking on a button click, that accumulate over the session, and, when selecting a ball, choosing to transfer those points. This is a transfer that they need to sign and will be sent on chain. The amount of points that the smartcontract has then will add the new ones, and there should be a state on amount of points that it has. Also the nation that belongs the ball should be in the state, neutral at the beginning, and another if someone claims it, or if someone from another nation attacks the ball and conquers it. For this the the attacking points that will get substracted to the original ball points, and if the number gets negative, the ball is conquered, and is part of the new nation with the amount of points resuling but in positive (Example: a ball had 10 points, gets attacked by nation 1 with 15, now the ball belongs to nation 1 with 5 points). A ball can only attack another one with maximum A) 90% of their current points B) 100% of the points that the user has created for its nation.  \ufeff \ufeffThe nations that are available can change over time, a user can create a new nation paying 0.02 eth and writing a name. The wallet of that user will belong to that nation. A user can join another nation for free as long as that wallet is not part of a nation so far, otherwise, a user can pay 0.005 eth for chainging nation, they can only select nations thta exits for this, or create a new nation.   The amount of nations and their stats will be loaded in NationStats.sol contract, which will have the total aomount of attacking points a nation has and the total number of balls. So when a ball gets attacked, this information has to go to the BallStats.sol and to the NationStats.sol. This should be displayed   The user should be able to see, on their wallets: How many points available they have, which nation they belong to, and how many points each ball has when clicking on it. To attack a ball the user will select one ball and click on attack and select another one, this will trigger a trasnasction they need to sign and the amount of points will get reduced from his balance and the ball\u2019s balance as well as from the attacked ball balance.  Focus now only on the BallStats.sol, the rest is for context",

Implemented the main functionalities: claiming balls, providing points, attacking balls, creating and joining nations.\n2. Used SafeMath for arithmetic operations to prevent overflows.\n3. Implemented access control using Ownable from OpenZeppelin.\n4. Added events for important state changes.\n5. Included view functions to get ball and nation statistics.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n- Users must join a nation before claiming a ball.\n- The contract assumes that ETH is the native currency of the blockchain it's deployed on.\n- The contract doesn't have a function to create balls; it assumes ball IDs exist and can be claimed.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Deploy the contract to your chosen network.\n2. Users should first create or join a nation before claiming balls.\n3. Ensure users have enough ETH to pay for transactions (claiming balls, creating nations, etc.).\n4. Use the provided functions to manage balls, points, and nations.\n\nRemember to replace the placeholder Ownable() constructor if you want to set a specific initial owner.\n",
